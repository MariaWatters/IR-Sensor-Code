# IR-Sensor-Code

This is the epitome of bare bones code. Basically the syntax for how to use an IR sensor to detect color (either white or black).
Note: No actual pin numbers were included because those change depending on how you have your robot wired.

The model number for this sensor is H048W.
  I have yet to test which color mode sets returns what value.
